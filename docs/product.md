# Product Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the product vision, goals, features, and roadmap. It serves as a central reference for product-related decisions and development priorities.

## Vision Statement

To provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use boilerplate for quickly bootstrapping new applications with best practices and modern development tools.

## Target Audience

- Developers starting new projects
- Teams looking for standardized project structures
- Startups needing to quickly set up technical infrastructure

## Problem Statement

Setting up a new project requires making many decisions about structure, tooling, and standards. This process is time-consuming and often results in inconsistent implementations. The boilerplate aims to solve this by providing a pre-configured foundation that follows best practices.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Core Features

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organized directory layout
   - Documentation templates
   - Configuration files

2. **Development Environment**
   - TypeScript configuration
   - ESLint and Prettier setup
   - Basic testing framework

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Basic build, test, and lint pipelines

4. **Documentation**
   - README with clear instructions
   - Project checklist
   - Architecture documentation

### Success Criteria

- A developer can clone the repository and start development within 10 minutes
- All core features are documented and working
- CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests the project

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Developer Experience

- VSCode configuration and recommended extensions
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- More comprehensive testing tools

### Phase 2: Extended Templates

- Multiple technology stack options (React, Vue, Node.js, Python)
- Database integration templates
- Authentication boilerplate

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployment configurations
- Monitoring and logging setup

## User Stories

### Developer

- As a developer, I want to quickly set up a new project with best practices, so I can focus on building features rather than configuration.
- As a developer, I want clear documentation on the project structure, so I can understand where to add new code.
- As a developer, I want pre-configured linting and formatting, so I can maintain code quality from the start.

### Project Manager

- As a project manager, I want standardized project structures across teams, so it's easier to onboard new developers.
- As a project manager, I want to ensure best practices are followed, so we minimize technical debt.

### DevOps Engineer

- As a DevOps engineer, I want CI/CD pipelines ready to use, so I can focus on customizing them for specific project needs.
- As a DevOps engineer, I want documentation on deployment processes, so I can set up environments quickly.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern component library/framework
- State management solution
- CSS/styling approach

### Backend

- API structure and documentation
- Authentication and authorization
- Database access patterns
- Error handling strategy

### DevOps

- CI/CD pipeline definition
- Environment configuration
- Deployment strategy
- Monitoring and logging

## Analytics and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Time to first working prototype
- Developer satisfaction survey results
- Number of reported issues with the boilerplate
- Adoption rate within the organization

## Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Create React App | Official React tool, well-maintained | Limited to React, opinionated | Our solution is more flexible and includes backend |
| Next.js | Full-stack capabilities, great DX | Specific to React, opinionated routing | Our solution offers more customization options |
| Vue CLI | Comprehensive Vue.js tooling | Limited to Vue ecosystem | Our solution is more technology-agnostic |

## Glossary

- **Boilerplate**: Pre-written code or templates that can be reused with minimal changes
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter
