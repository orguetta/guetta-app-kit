# AI Agent Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the AI agent components integrated with the application, including their purpose, capabilities, technical details, and guidelines for use.

## Capabilities

### Natural Language Processing
- Intent recognition
- Entity extraction
- Sentiment analysis
- Contextual understanding

### Knowledge Management
- Information retrieval from knowledge base
- Dynamic content generation
- Learning from user interactions

### Task Automation
- Process automation
- Scheduling and reminders
- Data extraction and transformation

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Language Model**: Foundation model responsible for understanding and generating text
2. **Context Manager**: Maintains conversation history and context
3. **Tool Integration**: Connects the agent with external tools and APIs
4. **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves information for long-term context
5. **Planning Module**: Breaks down complex tasks into actionable steps

### Data Flow
1. User input is processed by the language model
2. Context manager provides relevant conversation history
3. Intent and entities are extracted
4. Appropriate tools or responses are selected
5. Response is generated and delivered to the user
6. Interaction is stored in the memory system

## Integration

### API Endpoints

#### POST /agent/chat
Send a message to the AI agent.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Help me find information about...",
  "context": {
    "conversation_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "I found the following information...",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "search_result",
      "data": {
        "title": "Result title",
        "url": "https://example.com/result",
        "snippet": "Relevant text snippet"
      }
    }
  ],
  "conversation_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Configuration
The agent behavior can be configured through environment variables:

```
AI_MODEL=gpt-4
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
AI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
AI_MEMORY_CONTEXT_LENGTH=10
```

## Prompting Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Be specific and clear in instructions
2. Provide enough context for the agent to understand the task
3. Use consistent terminology
4. Break complex instructions into smaller steps
5. Use examples to demonstrate desired output format

### Example Prompts

#### Information Retrieval
```
Find the latest articles about [topic] and summarize the key points.
```

#### Data Analysis
```
Analyze this [data] and identify trends or patterns. Format the results as a bulleted list.
```

#### Content Generation
```
Create a [type of content] about [topic] in a [tone/style] voice, targeting [audience].
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling
- User inputs are processed securely
- Personal information is anonymized before processing
- Data retention policies comply with relevant regulations
- Users can request deletion of their conversation history

### Access Control
- Agent capabilities are restricted based on user permissions
- Sensitive operations require additional authentication
- All interactions are logged for security auditing

## Limitations

- The agent may occasionally generate incorrect information
- Complex or ambiguous requests may be misinterpreted
- Technical domain knowledge is limited to training data
- The agent cannot access real-time information unless integrated with external APIs

## Future Roadmap

- Enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Multimodal interactions (text, image, audio)
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific data
- Expanded tool integrations
